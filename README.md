1. Basic vulnerability scan using Nessus
   
I performed a basic vulnerability scan using Nessus, targeting the vulnerable machine with IP address 192.168.56.102.The scan completed successfully and identified multiple vulnerabilities with varying severity levels.

2. Analyze scan results
   
a. Review detected vulnerabilities by severity

According to the Nessus scan results, the vulnerabilities are categorized as follows:

Critical:10    High:6    Medium:24

b. Click on a few vulnerabilities to view:

I reviewed several detected vulnerabilities in detail. Here are some examples:

1)SSL DROWN Attack Vulnerability (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption)

Description: The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack known as DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption). This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private key.

CVE ID: CVE-2016-0800

Exploitability: Exploit Available: false. There is currently no known public exploit available for this vulnerability. Although it may pose a risk, exploitation is unlikely without advanced knowledge or internal access.

Suggested fixes: Disable SSLv2 and export grade cryptography cipher suites. Ensure that private keys are not used anywhere with server software that supports SSLv2 connections.

2)Apache Tomcat AJP Connector Request Injection (Ghostcat)

Description:A file read/inclusion vulnerability was found in AJP connector. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read web application files from a vulnerable server. In instances where the vulnerable server allows file uploads, an attacker could upload malicious JavaServer Pages (JSP) code within a variety of file types and gain remote code execution (RCE).

CVE ID: CVE-2020-1745

Exploitability: Exploit Available: true. This vulnerability is publicly known and can be exploited using tools or custom scripts. Attackers can use it to compromise the system remotely without needing special privileges.

Suggested fixes:Update the AJP configuration to require authorization and/or upgrade the Tomcat server to 7.0.100, 8.5.51, 9.0.31 or later.

3)SSL Anonymous Cipher Suites Supported

Description:The remote host supports the use of anonymous SSL ciphers. While this enables an administrator to set up a service that encrypts traffic without having to generate and configure SSL certificates, it offers no way to verify the remote host's identity and renders the service vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

CVE ID: CVE-2007-1858

Exploitability: Exploit Available: false. There is currently no known public exploit available for this vulnerability. Although it may pose a risk, exploitation is unlikely without advanced knowledge or internal access.

Suggested fixes: Reconfigure the affected application if possible to avoid use of weak ciphers.

3. Repeat with OpenVAS

I repeated the vulnerability assessment using OpenVAS.The scan detected the following vulnerabilities by severity:

Low:6    High:21    Medium:40

I also examined some vulnerabilities found by OpenVAS:

1)TWiki XSS and Command Execution Vulnerabilities

Description: TWiki is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Command Execution Vulnerabilities.

CVE ID:CVE-2008-5304

Exploitability: Exploit Available: True. This vulnerability is publicly known and can be exploited using tools or custom scripts. Attackers can use it to compromise the system remotely without needing special privileges.

Suggested fixes: Upgrade to version 4.2.4 or later.

2)phpMyAdmin 'error.php' Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

Description: phpMyAdmin is prone to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

CVE ID:CVE-2010-4480

Exploitability: Exploit Available: True. This vulnerability is publicly known and can be exploited using tools or custom scripts. Attackers can use it to compromise the system remotely without needing special privileges.

Suggested fixes: No known solution was made available for at least one year since the disclosure of this vulnerability. Likely none will be provided anymore. General solution options are to upgrade to a newer 
release, disable respective features, remove the product or replace the product by another one.

In conclusion, the vulnerability scans conducted using Nessus and OpenVAS successfully identified multiple security issues on the target machine.
